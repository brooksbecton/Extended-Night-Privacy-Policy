## Notes

### Items 

I'm glad to have the Items in the app now. I've had a few times where I'd want to know what an item does or what the point of the item was. There is very basic information about the items now, but I think there are some really interesting things that we can do within the app. 

I've been confused about the conditions, how bad they can get, and how you can fix them. So I'd like to have a way to look at the conditions details and, from the first aid items, navigate straight to them.

I'd also like to be able to link from tools to items that those tools can make or repair. 

### Journaling

I'm excited to start working on the Journaling feature. It was very popular on the original post on Reddit. 

["Nice app! Can you add a journal function? Like every new entry you can select the map , location and day. And take note how many thing you have lying there.." from u/KD6-24](https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/m3vdsi/i_made_a_mobile_companion_app_for_the_long_dark/gqs91fq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

The Journal isn't something I thought about and it's exciting to see great ideas like these coming from the community. 
I know that there is a journal in the game, but I plan to focus on making it easy and quick to jot down some notes about an area.
