## Notes


### New "Buy me a coffee" site

I have created a ["Buy me a coffee"](https://ko-fi.com/brooksbecton) site for those that have been asking if they can donate. Please do not feel like you are required to do so. To be clear, donating will not remove the ads in the app. 

### In app purchase to remove ads

I looked more into the possibility of adding the option to pay to remove ads within the app. There is a limitation with the technology I am using called Expo. Expo helps me develop features more quickly, but doesn't currently support In App Purchases (IAP). They may in the future.  

You are required to use Apple or Google's tools for IAP or risk getting your app removed if you try to go around it. 

There are ways to transition away from using Expo and I plan on doing this after adding the items, journaling, and maybe the backpack features. 

### Analytic Tools

I've added a some tools to help me understand how people are using the app. Because of this there is a new link in the app's [privacy policy](/privacy) and [terms](/termsandconditions) that links to that tools privacy policy and terms. Here are the links to their info [Google Analytics for Firebase Use Policy](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics) and [Google Analytics for Firebase Terms of Service](https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics)


## Thank You

I am still having so much fun devloping the app and appreciate everyone's support and feedback.
