## Notes

There should be no more issues installing to any region/country with the app. I have seen that people are able to install from countries that could not previously. 

There has been a few questions about adding/removing layers from the maps, such as, only showing wolfs areas or hide other things. Unfortunately, this won't be possible right now. I'm using the maps directly from [this forum post](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1901570789). These maps are amazing, but they are just flat images. This idea is very good and is typical in most map applications. I will continue to think about this and try to figure out how this could work.
