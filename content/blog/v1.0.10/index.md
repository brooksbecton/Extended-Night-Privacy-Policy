## Notes

There has been a few questions about adding layers to the maps, such as, only showing wolfs, being able to draw on the map, etc. These are great ideas, but would not be possible with how the maps are implemented currently. I'll continue to watch the tech powering the app to see if this can be done in the future.

This has been such an exciting project for me and I am so excited to have support from the community. Thank you all.
