Unfortunately, this won’t be possible right now. I’m using the maps directly from <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1901570789\">this forum post</a>. These maps are amazing, but they are just flat images. This idea is very good and is typical in most map applications. I will continue to think about this and try to figure out how this could work.</p>\n<h2>Thank You</h2>\n<p>This has been such an exciting project for me and I am so excited to have support from the community.
