Please do not feel like you are required to do so. To be clear, donating will not remove the ads in the app. </p>\n<h3>In app purchase to remove ads</h3>\n<p>I looked more into the possibility of adding the option to pay to remove ads within the app. There is a limitation with the technology I am using called Expo. Expo helps me develop features more quickly, but doesn’t currently support In App Purchases (IAP). They may in the future.  </p>\n<p>You are required to use Apple or Google’s tools for IAP or risk getting your app removed if you try to go around it. </p>\n<p>There are ways to transition away from using Expo and I plan on doing this after adding the items, journaling, and maybe the backpack features. </p>\n<h3>Analytic Tools</h3>\n<p>I’ve added a some tools to help me understand how people are using the app. Because of this there is a new link in the app’s <a href=\"/privacy\">privacy policy</a> and <a href=\"/termsandconditions\">terms</a> that links to that tools privacy policy and terms. Here are the links to their info <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics\">Google Analytics for Firebase Use Policy</a> and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics\">Google Analytics for Firebase Terms of Service</a></p>\n<h2>Thank You</h2>\n<p>I am still having so much fun devloping the app and appreciate everyone’s support and feedback. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Version 1.0.11","date":"April 05, 2021","description":"Transition Maps, Cairn Maps, Cave Maps, and Missing trophies"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/v1.0.10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Version 1.0.10"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"2050aeb7-5b5c-52d2-8f58-f8363932916c","previousPostId":"608b5d12-dbb1-5f4d-8bc2-c31fd5b06b0a","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
