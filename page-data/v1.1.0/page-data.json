I’ve had a few times where I’d want to know what an item does or what the point of the item was. There is very basic information about the items now, but I think there are some really interesting things that we can do within the app. </p>\n<p>I’ve been confused about the conditions, how bad they can get, and how you can fix them. So I’d like to have a way to look at the conditions details and, from the first aid items, navigate straight to them.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to be able to link from tools to items that those tools can make or repair. </p>\n<h3>Journaling</h3>\n<p>I’m excited to start working on the Journaling feature. It was very popular on the original post on Reddit. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/m3vdsi/i_made_a_mobile_companion_app_for_the_long_dark/gqs91fq?utm_source=share&#x26;utm_medium=web2x&#x26;context=3\">“Nice app! Can you add a journal function? Like every new entry you can select the map , location and day. And take note how many thing you have lying there..” from u/KD6-24</a></p>\n<p>The Journal isn’t something I thought about and it’s exciting to see great ideas like these coming from the community.\nI know that there is a journal in the game, but I plan to focus on making it easy and quick to jot down some notes about an area. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Version 1.1.0","date":"April 26, 2021","description":"Food Items, Fire Items, Fishing Items, and more!"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/v1.0.11/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Version 1.0.11"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"bab44be8-d978-51ae-9b4d-9ebcdaf2283c","previousPostId":"2050aeb7-5b5c-52d2-8f58-f8363932916c","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
