Certain functions of the app will\n        require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection\n        can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Brooks\n        Becton cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full\n        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any\n        of your data allowance left.\n      </p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p>\n        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should\n        remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network\n        provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your\n        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection\n        while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,\n        you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming\n        data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.\n        region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the\n        bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware\n        that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for\n        using the app.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Along the same lines, Brooks Becton cannot always take responsibility\n        for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device\n        stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to\n        avail the Service, Brooks Becton cannot accept responsibility.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        With respect to Brooks Becton’s responsibility for your use of the app,\n        when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although\n        we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we\n        do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can\n        make it available to you. Brooks Becton accepts no liability for any\n        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly\n        on this functionality of the app.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently\n        available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for both systems(and\n        for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the\n        app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want\n        to keep using the app. Brooks Becton does not promise that it will\n        always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with\n        the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device.\n        However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when\n        offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may\n        terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to\n        you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights\n        and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop\n        using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time.
